This work addresses the dynamic shortest path problem for dynamic
graphs where the cost of the arcs change, the topology change or both things
change along a time horizon. These situations appears in dynamic traffic, flows and/or
route planning for transportation networks.
We show the results of an adaptation of the Radix-Heap Dijkstra algorithm to
deal with the different kinds of dynamic networks. We show our results for
a number of selected dynamic graphs. We use the DYNAGRAPH software as a computational
environment to evaluate our methods.
We extend the DYNAGRAPH software creating a Features Editor, which allows
change the visual attributes of the vertices of a dynamic graph.
